## Introduction
```
"Better stock prices direction prediction is a key reference for better trading strategy and decision
making by ordinary investors and financial experts" (Kap, Chiu, Lu and Yang; 2013).
```

## Objective

Our project aims to implement a momentum strategy based on Machine Learning methods. The data consists of Date, Open, High, Low, Last and Volume. We calculated our predictors based on various technical indicators i.e. Exponential Moving Average, Stochastic Oscillator %K and %D, Relative Strength Index (RSI), Rate Of Change (ROC), Momentum (MOM) on which model was trained in order to forecast the direction of stock price. The predictions are used to build a momentum strategy that buy/sell when the next predicted price is above/below the last closing price.


## Feature Selection



## Data

We pulled the daily historical data from Morningstar. We chose 4 stocks (BIDU, MSFT, AAPL and TXN) in the technology sector of the NASDAQ. The time period is from 01/01/12 to 31/12/17.

## Model

We realized the following methods:
```KNN
Decision Tree
Random Forest
SVM
Gaussian Na√Øve Bayes
```
