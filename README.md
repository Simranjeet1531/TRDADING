ALGORITHM TRADING WITH MACHINE LEARNING METHODOLOGIES

Introduction
This project aims to use some machine learning methods to improve the performance of simply momentum strategy. 
In this project, we will first formulate and code a simple momentum algorithmic trading strategy on the stocks of two Chinese companies i.e. Tencent and Baidu. And then we will use Pandas to backtest the formulated trading strategy. Afterwards, we will see how we optimize the performance of the strategy by using the following machine learning methodologies: KNN, classification and regression trees.  

Datasets
The dataset are daily historical prices data of Tencent and Baidu from 2012-01-01 to 2017-12-31 on Yahoo Finance.
